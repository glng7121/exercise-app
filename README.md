A simple React exercise app for editing and running workouts where each set is of the same exercise, the break time is constant between sets, and the user has unlimited time to complete each set (as my dad requested :D). Comes with customized workout announcements during the run, so turn that audio up!

The app should be intuitive enough to use without reading the instructions below.

Instructions:

Customize your workout name, exercise, break time, and sets in the editor. (Tip: press the enter key while selecting an input field to jump to the next field!) Use the drop-down menu in the "name" field to switch between workouts, and use the New/Delete buttons on top of the editor to create/delete a workout. 

Press the large run button at the bottom of the page to run the selected workout. After you complete the first set, press the "End Set" button next to the set you finished to begin the break time countdown. When it ends, you will hear an announcement to begin the next set. Repeat until you press "End Set" for the last set. At any time, you may terminate the run the same way you started it.
